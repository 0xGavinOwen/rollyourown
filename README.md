# Roll Your Own

Roll Your Own will is a "mod" of the Dope World. It is an on-chain adaptation of the original Drug Wars game. As in the original, players will land in Dope Wars locations, arbitraging the price of drugs in an attempt to stack paper and own the streets.

RYO extends the core game mechanic of arbitraging drugs in different neighborhoods to a multiplayer environment where each player’s actions affect the in-game economy, creating a competitive and evolving environment. During each turn, a player will travel to a neighborhood, review the current market prices for drugs, and decide to Buy or Sell. After each turn is complete, the market prices will be affected by the previous player’s turn, adding a new layer of strategy to the game. Random events affect prices between turns to avoid making the game too deterministic.
